                Yeast is the magic ingredient that turns flat sugary wort into delicious alcohol filled homebrew
            </h2>
            <p>
                Without yeast, sugars extracted from malted grain during the 
                mash process would remain in the wort leaving our homebrew very
                sweet, un-carbonated, and boring.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are numerous homebrew yeast strains available today thanks
                to labs such as White Labs and Wyeast who keep the many different 
                strains of brewers yeast alive and available.
            
                Homebrew yeast can also play a very important role in the flavor
                of homebrew.

            If you are using the Brewgr homebrew recipe calculator
            to create a new homebrew recipe and the yeast strain
            you want to use is not listed, you can add a custom
            yeast strain by selecting "Add Custom Yeast"
            from the yeast drop down menu.
        </p>
        <p class="paddingright40">
            Once you've added a custom yeast strain, it will be available
            for any recipe you create.  If it is a yeast strain that can be used by
            other brewers, we will promote your custom
            yeast strain to a public yeast strain that can be used by other
            Brewgr users.
